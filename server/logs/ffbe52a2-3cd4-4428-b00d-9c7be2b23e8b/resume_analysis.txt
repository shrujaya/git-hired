- Any self-taught web development experience not mentioned
- Familiarity with web technologies through coursework
- Interest and timeline for learning React/Vue
- Understanding of web vs mobile development differences

## 5. Suggested Interview Strategy

### **Recommended Starting Level:** Easy to Medium
- Begin with fundamental concepts they should know
- Gradually increase complexity based on responses

### **Key Strengths to Validate:**
- **Problem-solving ability** through algorithmic questions
- **API integration skills** via practical scenarios
- **Learning capacity** given their academic excellence
- **System thinking** from their benchmarking project

### **Potential Weaknesses to Assess:**
- **Web development fundamentals** (HTML/CSS/DOM)
- **Frontend-specific challenges** (state management, rendering)
- **Browser compatibility and performance** concepts
- **Responsive design** understanding

### **Cultural/Behavioral Aspects:**
- Adaptability to new technology stack
- Collaboration in cross-functional teams
- Initiative in self-learning
- Communication of technical concepts

## 6. Warm-up Topics

### **Comfortable Starting Points:**
1. **iOS App Development Experience** - "Tell me about your hospital management app and the technical decisions you made"
2. **API Integration** - "How did you handle API responses and error states in your Gemini integration?"
3. **Performance Optimization** - "Walk me through your approach to memory and time profiling in your LLM benchmark"

## 7. Challenge Areas

### **Advanced Topics to Test Depth:**
1. **Cross-platform UI Concepts** - "How would you translate your SwiftUI knowledge to web development?"
2. **Large-scale Data Handling** - "Design a frontend interface for your entity extraction system that handles real-time processing updates"
3. **Performance at Scale** - "Given your experience with benchmarking, how would you approach frontend performance monitoring?"

## 🚨 **Key Recommendation:**

This candidate shows **strong technical aptitude and learning ability** but has a **significant skill gap** in core frontend requirements. They would be better suited for:
- **Junior/Trainee Frontend Developer** role with extensive onboarding
- **Full-stack role** leveraging their backend/AI skills while learning frontend
- **6-month timeline** to become productive in React/Vue

**Interview Strategy:** Focus on **potential over experience** - assess learning agility, problem-solving approach, and cultural fit rather than deep frontend knowledge.
